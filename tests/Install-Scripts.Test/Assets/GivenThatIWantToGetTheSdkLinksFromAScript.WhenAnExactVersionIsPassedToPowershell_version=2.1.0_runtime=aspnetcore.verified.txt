dotnet-install: Note that the intended use of this script is for Continuous Integration (CI) scenarios, where:

dotnet-install: - The SDK installation doesn't need to persist across multiple CI runs.
dotnet-install: To set up a development environment or to run apps, use installers rather than this script. Visit https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download to get the installer.
